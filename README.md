# Problem Statement

### KPI's Requirement
The HR department is responsible for monitoring and managing various aspects of employee data to ensure the organization maintains a healthy workforce. However, there is lack of clear performance indicators to track and analyze key HR metrics. Therefore, there is a need to design and implement a set of KPIs to address the following points:

1. **Employee Count:** The HR deparment lacks visibility into the total number of employees, making it challenging to assess workforce size and plan for future growth or downsizing effectively.
2. **Attrition Count:** The organization lacks a standardized method to track employee attrition, resulting in incomplete and unreliable data on the number of employees who have left the organization.
3. **Attrition Rate:** Without a clear measure of attrition rate, the organization cannot assess the overall turnover level or compare it with industry benchmakrs, hindering the ability to gauge employee statisfaction and engagement.
4. **Active Employees:** The organization lacks a mechanism to differentiate between active and inactive employees, leading to difficulties in accurately assessing the current worforce's productivity and capacity.
5. **Average Age:** The HR department lacks visibility into the average of employees, making it diffuclt to evaluate workforce demographics, succession planning, and the organization's ability to attract and retain younger talent.

### Charts Requirement

**Attrition by Gender:**
The HR department faces challenges in understanding the attrition patterns based on gender, making it difficult to indetify any gender-related disparities and implement targeted retention strategies.

**Department-wise Attrition:**
The HR department lacks visualizations to showcase attrition rates across different departments. This hinders their ability to identify departments with higher attrition rates and address any underlying issues or concerns effectively.

**Number of Employees by Age Group:**
The HR department requires visuals representations to analyze the distribution of employees across various age groups. This helps in assessing workforce demographics, identifying any age-related gaps or imbalances, and implementing targeted HR policies or programs.

**Jobs Statisfaction Ratings:**
The HR department lacks visualizations to represent job statisfaction ratings, hindering their ability to measure employee engagement and overall job statisfaction levels effectively.

**Education Field-wise Attrition:**
The HR department requires visual representations to anlyze attrition rates based on education fields. This helps identify specific educational backgrounds that may be associated with higher attrition, enabling the organization to tailor retention strategies accordingly.

**Attrition Rate by Gender for Different Age Groups:**
The HR department lacks visualizations that display attrition rates based on gender and different age groups. This makes it challenging to identify any age and gender-related attrition trends, preventing the organization from implementing targeted retention strategies for specific employee segments.
